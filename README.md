## Description 
This code-quiz project was created to develop an application tool designed for students to take a timed quiz that records high scores, assessing their progress in JavaScript fundamentals in comparison to others.

A starter code pack (as shown in the second commit) was provided, including the HTML files, CSS file, and a JavaScript file. Subsequently, the project was developed incorporating my newly acquired JavaScript knowledge. Below, I've highlighted the integration of these skills within the project:

- How to traverse through DOM accessing elements.
- Setting Attributes in JS and changing styles of elements.
- Create new and apending elements in JS.
- Setting timers Intervals
- Listen for a click event & keyboard events.
- Prevent default action.
- Event Bubbling
- Data Attributes
- Local storage

## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

To initiate the website experience, access the provided URL link and proceed by selecting the purple button labeled 'Start Quiz.' This action triggers a timer countdown of 75 seconds, initiating a series of JavaScript fundamentals quiz questions. The quiz begins with a start button, triggering a timer and revealing the initial question. Subsequent questions feature answer buttons, with the selection of an answer leading to the presentation of the next question. If an incorrect answer is chosen, time is deducted from the countdown clock. The quiz concludes either when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches zero. Upon completion, the website displays the user's score and offers the option to save their initials along with the achieved score.
