## Usage 
<!--
Open the webpage by clicking on the provided URL link. Click on the red button labeled 'Generate Password.' A window will prompt you to enter a number from 8 to 128, indicating your desired password length. Once you've entered the desired length, the system will ask you to confirm whether to include the four different character types. At least one character type must be included. If you enter a password length that is not in the provided range or don't any character type, the browser will prompt you again until the specified criteria are met. Finally, you will see a randomly generated password based on your selected character type(s) in the dashed box. To generate a new random password, simply refresh the page and repeat the above steps.
